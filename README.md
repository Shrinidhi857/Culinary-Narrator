# Culinary Narrator

is an innovative system designed to generate and narrate cooking recipes.
By leveraging the power of C and Python, this project uses a Large Language Model (LLM) from Meta to create detailed recipe steps. 
The process begins with a C program generating prompts, which are then read by a Python script. 
The LLM processes these prompts to generate text, which is ultimately converted into speech,
providing an interactive cooking experience.
